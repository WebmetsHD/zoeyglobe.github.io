<h2>[1] Sam (5 minute short story)<br><sup>posted by Zoey [Thu Jan 25th, 2018]</sup></h2>

<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:14px;">I wrote this in about 5 minutes around the middle of December 2017 when I was in a horribly depressed mood about a week before I left my college. I was considering handing it in for my English class homework, but I didn't want them to inform my parents.<br><b>Don't worry, I'm much happier now than I was when I wrote this.</b></p><br><br>

<div style="border: 1px solid darkgray; padding:5px; font-size:16px; width:530px;">
The sound of breaking glass within earshot of her bedroom door rarely had Sam worried, her heavily-inebriated father was breaking things all the time in a drunken haze- and it's not like it would be the first time Sam had cut herself on her father's bottle-remains, well, if she cut herself by <i>accident</i> it <i>would be</i> a first.<br><br>But hey~ let's not be thinking about that tonight, right?- can't have anybody <span style="color:gray"><i>visiting</i></span> me in my time of need, can I?<br><br><i>Think of nice things, nice.. pretty things.., &#9835; everything is fiine~&#9835;, <b>not tonight, fucking damn it!</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray"><br><br>Hearing voices again are we, <b>Samuel</b>?</i></span><sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>"that's not my name..."</i></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray"><br><br><i>You know, there's only one place that little <b>boys</b> like you go with voices in their head, Samuel.</i></span><sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>"whatever you're thinking, it's better than here.."</i></sub><b><br><sup>warm blood trickles from a self-created wound, running down the twitching arm and onto the cold ground.<p style="color:red;"><br><br><sub><sub><p style="line-height:8px; font-size:12px; font-weight:700;">Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?
